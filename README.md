dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles that I use between machines and environments.

Run ./dotfiles/makesymlinks.sh after cloning.
This will move old dotfiles into ./dotfiles_old and make soft links from ./dotfiles into the dotfiles repo.

Don't run makesymlinks.sh twice, or you'll lose your files!
