dotfiles
========

These are my dotfiles that I use between machines and environments.

Run ./dotfiles/makesymlinks.sh after cloning.
This will move old dotfiles into ./dotfiles_old and make soft links from ./dotfiles into the dotfiles repo.

Some operating systems have specific startup scripts to install dependencies, e.g. `ubuntu.sh` and `ubuntu-wsl.sh`.
